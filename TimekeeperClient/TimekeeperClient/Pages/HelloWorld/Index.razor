            <h2>Try it by yourself</h2>*@

        </div>

        @*<h2>This is a proof of concept application.</h2>

            <p>Imagine that you are the host for a streamed show, doing some recordings, or any activity where you have a remote guest. One of the hardest parts is to keep track of time, and to let your guests know when the time is coming to an end.</p>

            <p>This application offers a solution to the problem.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Send the URL to your guests and ask them to load this on a phone, PC, Mac.</li>
                <li>When ready, start the clock. All your guests will see the exact same time.</li>
                <li>After a predefined time, the screen turns green, yellow and then red for all guests.</li>
                <li>The Host can send messages to the guests.</li>
                <li>The Host can configure the countdown time, as well as background colors at predefined times.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Plans for later</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>The Host will be able to set up predefined messages.</li>
                <li>The Host will be able to pause/resume the clock.</li>
                <li>The Host will be able to prepare, save and run multiple sessions at once.</li>
                <li>Maybe more...</li>
