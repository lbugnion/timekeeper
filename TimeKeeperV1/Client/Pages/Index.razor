        <blockquote>
            Timekeeper is a simple app running on PC, Mac and mobile phones. It allows a host and their guests (for example on a live stream) to keep track of time.

        <h2>Try it by yourself</h2>

        <div class="controls-area">
            <button @onclick="LogInHost">Log in as the host</button>
        </div>

        <h2>This is a work in progress.</h2>

        <p>Imagine that you are the host for a streamed show, doing some recordings, or any activity where you have a remote guest. One of the hardest parts is to keep track of time, and to let your guests know when the time is coming to an end.</p>

        <p>This application offers a solution to the problem.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Send the URL to your guests and ask them to load this on a phone, PC, Mac.</li>
            <li>When ready, start the clock. All your guests will see the exact same time.</li>
            <li>After a predefined time, the screen turns green, yellow and then red for all guests.</li>
            <li>The Host can send messages to the guests.</li>
            <li>The Host can configure the countdown time, as well as background colors at predefined times.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Plans for later</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>The Host will be able to set up predefined messages.</li>
            <li>The Host will be able to pause/resume the clock.</li>
            <li>The Host will be able to prepare, save and run multiple sessions at once.</li>
            <li>Maybe more...</li>
        </ul>
