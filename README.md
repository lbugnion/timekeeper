# Timekeeper

> Timekeeper is a simple app running on PC, Mac and mobile phones. It allows a host and their guests (for example on a live stream) to keep track of time.

This is a proof of concept application.

Imagine that you are the host for a streamed show, doing some recordings, or any activity where you have a remote guest. One of the hardest parts is to keep track of time, and to let your guests know when the time is coming to an end.

This application offers a solution to the problem.

* Send the URL to your guests and ask them to load this on a phone, PC, Mac.
* When ready, start the clock. All your guests will see the exact same time.
* After a predefined time, the screen turns green, yellow and then red for all guests.
* The Host can send messages to the guests.

## Plans for later

* The Host will be able to set up predefined messages.
* The Host will be able to configure the countdown time, green, yellow and red times.
* The Host will be able to define if the display should blink when the clock goes over.
* The Host will be able to pause/resume the clock.
* Maybe more...
